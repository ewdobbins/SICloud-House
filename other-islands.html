			<h3>Black Island, Placentia Island</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left" >These two islands lay across the Eastern Passage, just over a mile off our shorefront. Placentia is most recently known for the Kellam's, Arthur and Nan, who moved to Placentia island in 1949, acquiring the island for $10,000. The book <i>We Were an Island</i> by Peter Blanchard chronicles their time on the island. The story of the Kellam's is also told in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/13/garden/living-to-the-power-of-two.html">New York Times story</a> from 2003.  Another <a href="https://mdihistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2006_2007-The-Kellams_ocr-.pdf"> article</a>, by Peter Blanchard, is on the MDI History web site . The remains of their home, Homewood, are still visible on the island.
			<br><br>
			Black Island also enjoys a rich history, covered in some detail by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/black-island-and-little-black-island">web page for the island</a>. There you can read about the quarry and rail line still visible and the hiking avilable.</p>
