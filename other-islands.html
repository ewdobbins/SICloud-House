			<h3>Black Island, Placentia Island</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left" >These two islands lay across the Eastern Passage, just over a mile off our shorefront. Placentia is most recently known for the Kellam's, Arthur and Nan, who moved to Placentia island in 1949, acquiring the island for $10,000. The book <i>We Were an Island</i> by Peter Blanchard chronicles their time on the island. The story of the Kellam's is also told in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/13/garden/living-to-the-power-of-two.html">New York Times story</a> from 2003.  Another <a href="https://mdihistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2006_2007-The-Kellams_ocr-.pdf"> article</a>, by Peter Blanchard, is on the MDI History web site . The remains of their home, Homewood, are still visible on the island.
			<br><br>
			Black Island also enjoys a rich history, covered in some detail by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/black-island-and-little-black-island">web page for the island</a>. There you can read about the quarry and rail line still visible and the hiking avilable.</p>

			<h3>Marshall Island</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left" >This island is to the west of Swan's Island and has several hiking trails, camp sites and beaches(such as they are in Maine) as detailed on <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/marshall-island">the MCHT preserve page for Marshall Island</a>. Another notable attraction is an <a href="./images/Marshall-island.jpg">overgrown airstrip</a> that marks the remains of a 1970s attempt to turn the island into an upscale retreat.  </p>

			<p class="left" >There is a very nice sand beach in the western side of Sand Cove. On a warm, sunny day the water is somewhat tolerable and the beach is very nice to lay back and relax on, do a <a href="./images/Marshall12.jpg">cookout</a> or engage in a game of "Washers". There is also a trail head to enter the island trail system from. While it is remote, and requires a boat to get to, it is not uncommon to see several fishing boats and cruising sailboats <a href="./images/Marshall11.jpg">anchored</a> on a nice summer weekend.</p>

			<h3> Asa Island (aka "Sputty-world")</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left"> A small island on the western edge of Mackerel Cove with a viable beach area that provides a close, private location for an afternoon at the beach as well as <a href="./images/Asa1.jpg">great views</a> back to Mt. Desert Island. At only 1.5 miles from the ferry terminal/dinghy dock it can be reached using the <a href="./images/Baby-bongo.JPG">AB tender</a>.</p>

			<h3>Isle au Haut</h3>			
			<div >
			<p class="left"> A bit to the west of Swan's Island, a sizable island that is partially <a href="https://www.nps.gov/acad/isle-au-haut.htm">Acadia park land,</a> with good hiking on over 20 miles of trails. A narrow channel separates Isle au Haut from Kimball Island providing a great view of the harbors on each end. The lighthouse at Robinson point provides a <a href="./images/Isle-au-haut1.jpg">scenic backdrop</a> as well </p>

			<h3>Long Island(Frenchboro)</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left">This island is just to the south of Swan's Island. The <a href="https://mcht.org/">Maine Coast Heritage Trust</a> maintains a <a href="https://mcht.org/perch/resources/preserve_maps/frenchborowebmap-1.pdf">large preserve</a> on the island (a majority of the island) and there are many trails available. There is  <a href="./images/Lunts2.jpg">lunch</a> and dessert available at <a href="./images/Lunts.jpg">Lunts Deli</a> on the dock.</p>

			<h3>the Cranberries</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left">These islands lay just to the south of Southwest Harbor. They both have some level of restaurants and enough attractions to warrant a day of exploration. Little Cranberry (aka Isleford) is home of the <a href="https://www.islesforddock.com/">Islesford Dock</a>, which is a very competent restaurant with a great <a href="./images/ID2.JPG">menu</a>, <a href="./images/ID3.JPG">food</a> and <a href="./images/ID1.JPG">drink</a>. <a href="./images/Isleford-dock-1.JPG">Well worth</a> a trip but reservations may be required.  </p>

			<h3>Mount Desert Rock, aka "the Rock"</h3>			
			<div >
			<p class="left">	<a href="https://www.coa.edu/islands/mount-desert-rock/">Mount Desert Rock</a> is a <a href="./images/MDRock4.JPG">lonely windswept perch</a> sitting <a href="./images/MDRock2.PNG"> 15 miles southeast</a> of Swan's Island and one of the most isolated and desolate locations used as a lighthouse site in the Unisted States. It is operated by the College of the Atlantic and is an intriguing destination, if somewhat challenging to get to. In addition to the lighthouse there is a fair chance of sighting a whale and much better one of <a href="./images/MDRock3.JPG">seeing seals</a> congregating close to the shore,  or <a href="./images/MDRock6.jpg">other visitors</a>. A trip out there is best done on a <a href="./images/MDRock1.jpg">calm day</a>, potentially with a <a href="./images/MDRock5.JPG">brunch theme</a> on the trip out!</a></p>

			<p class="left">	<a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/buckle-island">Buckle Island</a> is located just off the northwest coast of Swan's Island and is the location of some spontaneous art exhibits. The harbor is also a excellent location to drop a hook and enjoy lunch or dinner on the boat.</p>
