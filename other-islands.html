			<h3>Black Island, Placentia Island</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left" >These two islands lay across the Eastern Passage, just over a mile off our shorefront. Placentia is most recently known for the Kellam's, Arthur and Nan, who moved to Placentia island in 1949, acquiring the island for $10,000. The book <i>We Were an Island</i> by Peter Blanchard chronicles their time on the island. The story of the Kellam's is also told in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/13/garden/living-to-the-power-of-two.html">New York Times story</a> from 2003.  Another <a href="https://mdihistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2006_2007-The-Kellams_ocr-.pdf"> article</a>, by Peter Blanchard, is on the MDI History web site . The remains of their home, Homewood, are still visible on the island.
			<br><br>
			Black Island also enjoys a rich history, covered in some detail by the Maine Coast Heritage Trust <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/black-island-and-little-black-island">web page for the island</a>. There you can read about the quarry and rail line still visible and the hiking avilable.</p>

			<h3>Marshall Island</h3>
			<div >
			<p class="left" >This island is to the west of Swan's Island and has several hiking trails, camp sites and beaches(such as they are in Maine) as detailed on <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/marshall-island">the MCHT preserve page for Marshall Island</a>. Another notable attraction is an <a href="./images/Marshall-island.jpg">overgrown airstrip</a> that marks the remains of a 1970s attempt to turn the island into an upscale retreat.  </p>

			<p class="left" >There is a very nice sand beach in the western side of Sand Cove. On a warm, sunny day the water is somewhat tolerable and the beach is very nice to lay back and relax on, do a <a href="./images/Marshall12.jpg">cookout</a> or engage in a game of "Washers". There is also a trail head to enter the island trail system from. While it is remote, and requires a boat to get to, it is not uncommon to see several fishing boats and cruising sailboats <a href="./images/Marshall11.jpg">anchored</a> on a nice summer weekend.</p>

A narrow channel separates Isle au Haut from Kimball Island providing a great view of the harbors on each end. The lighthouse at Robinson point provides a scenic backdrop as well </p>
