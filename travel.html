		<h2>Traveling to Swan's Island</h2>

		<p> Swan’s Island is, well, an island. And a class of Maine island known as “non-bridged” islands. So you can’t just drive there. In fact, you will find that there is at least six miles of sea water separating you from the closest point you can drive to and Swan’s Island. Luckily there are ways to get across this moat. There is a <a href="./images/SIFerry.JPG">ferry service </a> that is operated by the state of Maine. It runs six times a day in the summer out of Bass Harbor. There are “water taxi” services out of Northeast and Southwest Harbor (maybe Stonington too). And a call to us at the Cloud House can almost certainly rustle up a ride on our boat, <a href="bongo-fury.html">Bongo Fury</a>. </p>

		<p>Practically speaking the most flexible jumping off point is Bass Harbor. From there you can drive on to the ferry (pending availability or a reservation). You can walk on with no reservation (and leave your car in a lot for ferry customers) as well. Or you can get picked up at the dock by us in our boat from a variety of ports in the region if you are <a href="./images/Sea-trial.JPG">up for a boat ride.</a> </p>

		<p>Here is more detail on the possible ports to  depart from though:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://acadiamagic.com/BassHarbor.html" >Bass Harbor</a>- Preferred jumping off point due to being closest port to Swan’s Island, having a ferry service to the island and parking for passengers. The downside is this is almost certainly the longest drive, taking you to the southern end of MDI.</li>
			<li><a href="https://acadiamagic.com/SouthwestHarbor.html">Southwest Harbor</a>-This is around the corner from Bass Harbor. For a pickup from our boat  this can be a good location. You can get picked up at Dysarts Great Bay Marina, where we have a slip for the season. Another possible pickup location is Beales, after a delicious lobster meal. Southwest Harbor also affords you the chance to rent your own boat. We had an excellent experience renting a boat (22’ Angler) from <a href="http://www.mansetyachtservice.com/" >Manset Yacht Service</a>. You would need to demonstrate to “Capt Bob” some level of nautical familiarity though.</li>
			<li><a href="https://acadiamagic.com/NortheastHarbor.html">Northeast Harbor</a> - Across the sound from Southwest Harbor this port also offers a pickup point on the town dock. Both ports allegedly offer some level of water taxi service but they are limited and relatively expensive, and possibly non-existent.</li>
			<li><a href="https://acadiamagic.com/bar-harbor/">Bar Harbor</a> - If you are headed in this general direction it may be to Bar Harbor, the most recognized locale in the Mount Desert Island/Acadia area. If you find yourself in Bar Harbor, and fancy an impromptu visit to Swan’s Island, give us a call and we can almost certainly swing over on the boat and pick you up.</li>
			<li><a href="https://visitmaine.com/places-to-go/downeast-and-acadia/stonington">Stonington(Deer Island)</a> - If you find yourself on Deer Island you are not far away from Swan’s Island, by water. Give us a call and we can pick you up by boat in Stonington or one of the eastern harbors on Deer Island. </li>
			<li><a href="http://www.rocklandmainevacation.com/">Rockland</a> - This port is over on the west side of the Penobscot Bay. Dropping your car here (there is significant parking at the Vinylhaven ferry terminal) will cut 2-3 hours off your drive, compared to Bass Harbor. The boat ride from the dock there to Swan's Island is about an hour but is fairly sheltered, with great views of the bay islands as you pass through the Fox Island and Deer Island thorofares.</li>

		</ul>
			
			<h2>The Ferry
			</h2>
			<p>The Swan's Island ferry departs from Bass Harbor several times a day see the <a href="https://www.maine.gov/mdot/ferry/swansisland/">Maine State Ferry Service </a> for details and current information. </p>
