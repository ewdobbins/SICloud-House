			<h2>M/V Bongo Fury</h2>
			<p>M/V (Motor/Vessel) Bongo Fury is our boat which we will keep moored in Mackerel Cove on Swan’s Island (and <a href="./images/BF-storage.JPG">tucked away</a> in the Hinckley shed for the winter across Blue Hill Bay on Southwest Harbor).</p> 

			<p>Bongo Fury is a 2008 Hinckley <a href="https://www.hinckleyyachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Soundings_Oct2014_Hinckley_Book_Spreads.pdf">Picnic Boat</a> (Extended Pilothouse). It can pretty easily accommodate <a href="./images/BF-seating.jpg">6-10 passengers</a> and crew. With a <a href="bongo-fury-video.html">cruising speed of 25 knots and a top end of about 30 knots</a> it makes many local “remote” islands readily accessible as well as lunch or dinner at the mainland ports a viable option. An “emergency” run to Sawyer’s market in Southwest Harbor, or the Hannaford in Bar Harbor, is also in the realm of possibility for our visitors to Swan’s Island. </p>

			<p>The boat has reasonable accommodations for its purpose (a “picnic boat”). There is a <a href="./images/BF-galley.jpg">galley</a> below deck with a refrigerator, a propane cooktop and a microwave. There is a <a href="./images/BF-head.jpg">head</a> with a sink, toilet and hand held shower. A <a href="./images/BF-berth.jpg">V-berth</a> provides sleeping accommodations for two in the forward cabin. </p>

			<p>Bongo Fury was shipped from Oxford, MD in April of 2019 to Southwest Harbor and stored in the Hinckley "sheds" there. Pictures from the sea trial and storage are viewable <a href="BF-info.html">here</a>.

			<p>The name “Bongo Fury” comes from the title of the Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart collaborative album in 1975, with several songs recorded in Austin, Texas at the Armadillo Lounge. The phase <i>“bongo fury”</i> appears in the closing verses of  the song <i>Sam With The Showing Scalp Flat Top:</i></p>
