			<h2>M/V Bongo Fury</h2>
			<p>M/V (Motor/Vessel) Bongo Fury is our boat and during the season it is moored in <a href="./images/Mackerel-mooring.jpg">Mackerel Cove</a> on Swan’s Island, or tied up at a slip in <a href="./images/Dysarts3.JPG"> Dysarts Marina</a> (guarded by <a href="./images/RIO1.JPG">RIO</a>) in Southwest Harbor on the mainland.  In the off season it is  <a href="./images/BF-storage.JPG">tucked away</a> in a warm Hinckley shed for the winter across Blue Hill Bay on Southwest Harbor).
			</p> 

			<p>Bongo Fury is a 2008 Hinckley <a href="https://www.hinckleyyachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Soundings_Oct2014_Hinckley_Book_Spreads.pdf">Picnic Boat</a> (Extended Pilothouse). It can pretty easily accommodate <a href="./images/BF-seating.jpg">6-10 passengers</a> and crew. With a <a href="bongo-fury-video.html">cruising speed of 25 knots and a top end of about 30 knots</a> it makes many local “remote” islands <a href="bongo-fury-video2.html">readily accessible</a> as well as lunch or dinner at the mainland ports a viable option. An “emergency” run to Sawyer’s market in Southwest Harbor, or the Hannaford in Bar Harbor, is also in the realm of possibility for our visitors to Swan’s Island. </p>

			<p>The boat has reasonable accommodations for its purpose (a “picnic boat”). There is a <a href="./images/BF-galley.jpg">galley</a> below deck with a refrigerator, a propane cooktop and a microwave. There is a <a href="./images/BF-head.jpg">head</a> with a sink, toilet and hand held shower. A <a href="./images/BF-berth.jpg">V-berth</a> provides sleeping, or napping, accommodations for two in the forward cabin. The pilot house and cabin have heating and cooling so the season is extended, mostly by the heating capability.</p>

			<p>Bongo Fury was shipped from Oxford, MD in April of 2019 to Southwest Harbor. Off season it is stored in the Hinckley "sheds" there. Pictures from the sea trial and winter storage are viewable <a href="BF-info.html">here</a>. It is now on the water in the Blue Hill Bay area and has been exploring  <a href="./images/BF-Bar-Harbor.JPG">Bar Harbor</a>, <a href="./images/Somes-sound-BF.JPG">Somes Sound </a> and over to <a href="./images/BF-Marshall.JPG">Marshall Island</a>. More background on going out on the water with us is available <a href="bongo-fury-faq.html">here</a>. </p>

			<p>Bongo Fury has a tender in the form of an <a href="./images/Tender1.JPG">8.5' AB Inflatable powered by a Torqeedo 1003C  electric outboard motor</a>. While the tender is primarily intended to be <a href="./images/Tender2.JPG">carried on the stern </a> for transport ashore to remote islands, it is also available by itself for an exploration in the <a href="./images/Mackerel-cove.JPG">sheltered Mackerel Cove</a> area on Swan's Island. The Torqueedo will provide approximately 6 hours of runtime (18 nmiles) at half throttle or an hour  (5 nmiles) at a frisky 5 knots, full throttle. It includes a display that accurately shows speed and remaining charge/range so you can confidently plan round trips. 

			<p>The name “Bongo Fury” comes from the title of the Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart collaborative album in 1975, with several songs recorded in Austin, Texas at the Armadillo Lounge. The phase <i>“bongo fury”</i> appears in the closing verses of  the song <i>Sam With The Showing Scalp Flat Top:</i></p>
