			<h2>M/V Bongo Fury, et al</h2>
			<section >
			<div >
			<p class="left">M/V (Motor/Vessel) <i>Bongo Fury </i>is the power boat we have on the island. During the boating season(end of May to early October) it is moored in <a href="./images/Mackerel-cove5.JPG">Mackerel Cove</a> on Swan’s Island.  In the off season it is  <a href="./images/BF-storage.JPG">tucked away</a> in a warm Hinckley shed for the winter, across Blue Hill Bay on Southwest Harbor).

			<p class="left"><i>Bongo Fury</i> is,  more specifically, a 2008 Hinckley <a href="https://www.hinckleyyachts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Soundings_Oct2014_Hinckley_Book_Spreads.pdf">Picnic Boat</a> (Extended Pilothouse). It can pretty easily accommodate <a href="./images/BF-cruise1.JPG">6-10 passengers</a> and crew. With a <a href="bongo-fury-video.html">cruising speed of 25 knots and a top end of about 30 knots</a> it makes many local “remote” islands <a href="bongo-fury-video2.html">readily accessible</a> for exploring as well as lunch or <a href="./images/Isleford-dock.JPG">dinner</a> at the mainland (or other island) ports a viable option.  </p>

			<p class="left">The boat has reasonable accommodations for its purpose (a “picnic boat”). There is a <a href="./images/BF-galley.jpg">galley</a> below deck with a refrigerator, a propane cooktop and a <a href="./images/BF-microwave.jpg">microwave</a>. Above deck is a <a href="./images/BF-grilling.jpg"> gas grill</a>, <a href="./images/BF-cooler.jpg">cooler and sink</a> with hot/cold water. There is also a <a href="./images/BF-head.jpg">head</a> with a sink, toilet and hand held shower. A <a href="./images/BF-berth.jpg">V-berth</a> provides sleeping, or napping, accommodations for two in the forward cabin. The pilot house and cabin have heating and cooling so the season is extended, mostly by the heating capability.</p>

			<p class="left"><i>Bongo Fury</i> was shipped from Oxford, MD in April of 2019 to Southwest Harbor. It now spends summers <a href="./images/BF-sunset.JPG">on the water</a> in the Blue Hill Bay area and has explored destinations such as  <a href="./images/BF-Bar-Harbor.JPG">Bar Harbor</a>, <a href="./images/Somes-sound-BF.JPG">Somes Sound </a> and <a href="./images/BF-Marshall.JPG">Marshall Island</a>. </p>

			<p class='left'><i>Bongo Fury</i> has a tender(dinghy) in the form of an <a href="./images/Baby-bongo.JPG">8.5' AB Inflatable</a> powered by a <a href="https://www.torqeedo.com/us/en-us/news-and-press/blog/blog-2017-06-22.html">Torqeedo 1003C</a>  electric outboard motor. It is affectionately known by the nickname, <i>Baby Bongo</i>. While the tender is primarily intended to be <a href="./images/Tender3.jpg">carried on the stern </a> for transport ashore to remote islands, it is also available by itself for exploration in the <a href="./images/Mackerel-cove.JPG">sheltered Mackerel Cove</a> area on Swan's Island. The Torqeedo will provide approximately 6 hours of runtime (18 nmiles) at half throttle or an hour  (5 nmiles) at a frisky 5 knots, full throttle. This is more than enough range to explore the harbor islands from the Mackerel Cove dinghy dock on a quiet day. The motor includes a display that accurately shows speed and remaining charge/range so you can confidently plan round trips. </p>

			<p>The name “Bongo Fury” comes from the title of the Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongo_Fury">collaborative album</a> in 1975, with several songs recorded in Austin, Texas at the Armadillo Lounge. The phase <i>“bongo fury”</i> appears in the closing verses of  the song <i>Sam With Thttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongo_Furyhe Showing Scalp Flat Top:</i></p>
