		<h2>Boating considerations</h2>

		<p> So you are ready to spend a day out on the water? Or maybe just a run across the bay for a restaurant or shopping? It’s not exactly like stepping on to the Maine state ferry. Here are some things to consider, and be prepared for as well as a FAQ. 
		</p>


		<ul>

			<li>Shoes. <i>If you are planning on spending the day on the boat then boat shoes, or non marking shoes, are a must. If it’s a dock-to-dock run across the bay you could slip off your hiking shoes and go barefoot for the run across. For a day, or partial day, of cruising around the islands please bring an appropriate shoe. <a href="./images/Swabbing.JPG">Scrubbing marked decks is no fun.</a> <br /><br />

			If we are headed for a remote island landing , with no docks and requiring a tender ride to shore, a water shoe is also recommended. In this case the last few steps to get ashore will be through the water and doing it barefoot can be a challenge due to slippery footing and the potential for sharp barnacles. </i></li><br />

			<li><a href="./images/BF-jacket.jpg">Jacket.</a> <i>With the wind and cooler temps off shore be ready for a cooler environment than dockside.</i></li><br />

			<li>Children's Life Jacket. <i>We have several (8+) adult life jackets but do not have any that are suitable for children.</i></li><br />

			<li>Sunglasses and sunscreen. <i>The water reflects sunlight making glare and sunburn more likely. You can duck into the pilothouse to get out of the sun as well. </i></li>

		</ul>

		<h3>FAQ</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>What is the bathroom situation?
				<ul><li><i>There is a <a href="./images/BF-head.jpg">civilized bathroom</a> below deck, with running water.</i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Is there a cooler?
				<ul><li><i>There is a powered refrigerator in the galley that has a limited capacity. There is also an <a href="./images/BF-cooler.jpg">integrated cooler</a> above deck. It requires ice. </i></li></ul></li>
			<li>How about a grill?
				<ul><li><i>There is a <a href="./images/BF-grill.jpg"> modest sized gas grill</a> we can deploy off one of the fishing rod holders. A microwave is also  available for reheating and a two burner cooktop for delicate sauce work. </i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Where can we go? 
				<ul><li><i>Since 25 knots is a comfortable cruising speed, use that as a radius around Swan’s Island. You will find there are <a href="./images/SI-NOAA.jpg">many interesting destinations</a> well inside that circle.</i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Will I get seasick?
				<ul><li><i>Probably not. The boat is quite stable, we will be in sight of land and you will be above deck which all counteract sea sickness.</i></li></ul></li>

			<li>Will I be put to work as crew?
				<ul><li><i>Not unless you want to...and can tie a knot. </i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Will I have internet access to post my clever social media updates?
				<ul><li><i>Maybe. There is shockingly good cellular coverage in Blue Hill Bay. But don’t count on it elsewhere.</i></li></ul></li>
			<li>I remember the plot of Jaws (or more recently, The Meg), <a href="./images/Lobster-museum.jpg">what’s the shark situation?</a>
				<ul><li><i>There are allegedly sharks out there, the local fishermen have some interesting stories.  While we would not recommend being towed on a boogie board, dressed as a seal, pitching chum,  in reality you will be seeing actual seals, porpoises and possibly a whale as we make our way around but not a shark. [At least not a great white. ]<i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Can I fish off the boat?
				<ul><li><i>Maybe. The boat is equipped with four rod holders. The “maybe” relates to Maine state salt water fishing licensing. Check <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dmr/recreational-fishing/licenses/registry.html" >here</a> for the details. The TL:DR is that it cost all of 1$ to get a license but you would need to do it in advance. <i></li></ul></li>
			<li>Can I go swimming off the boat?
				<ul><li><i>The answer is an extremely qualified "yes". There is a <a href="./images/Swim-platform2.JPG"> full swim platform </a>, transom door and extending ladder at the stern. In addition there is a fresh water hand-held shower in the transom door to wash off salt water with. What is the qualification? The Maine water is cold. Very cold. With the exception of some "beaches" that are reputed to have tolerable water temps at low tide, any other dip in the water might warrant a wet suit. </i></li></ul></li>
