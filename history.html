	<p>This page is a work in progress. We have heard the house dates to the 1850â€™s but recently heard the date of 1894 as when it was built. The most recent history dates back 70 years, the length of time the family we bought the property from owned it. As we learn more details about the history of the property we will detail it here. For now, we will just use this page to collect vintage pictures of the property and notes associated with them. </p>

	<p>The origin of the name "Cloud House" seems to go back to a tenant who would winterize the property by putting boards up over the windows, and painting clouds on them. There was also a door on the second floor which was painted with clouds on it. </p>

		Swan's Island has <a href="http://www.themaineblog.com/island-ghosts-zombies-and-scaring-oneself-silly/">many stories of hauntings</a> and the Cloud House figures prominently in them. In a local podcast there was a spirited (pun intended) discussion of recent paranormal activity occuring during the demolition work this winter, which also included a reference to the Cloud House as "one of the most notoriously haunted houses on the island". Click <a href="http://thesaltyseamanpodcast.libsyn.com/website/haunted-swans-island-1">here</a> to get to the podcast,  and skip to the 11:30 mark where the discusion of the current, and historical, Cloud House paranormal activity starts. Or listen to the entire podcast. It is a fun and entertaining slice of Swan's Island. </p>
