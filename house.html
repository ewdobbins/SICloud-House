			<h2>The Cloud House</h2>
			<p style="display:inline-block; width: 60%; float: left;">We came to Swan’s Island in the fall of 2017 almost by chance. We wanted to take the ferry out to Swan’s Island, check it out for the day, and come back to MDI. As it turns out the ferry was full, no car slots left, but they were able to squeeze <a href="./images/SI2017Bike.JPG">our Honda VF700 Interceptor</a> on. We spent just a few hours there, not wanting to wait to the last ferry. In that short time we went to the lighthouse, enjoyed a delicious lunch at <a href="http://www.tims-swans-island.com/">TIMS </a>and managed to cover most of the paved roads, driving by the Cloud house and noting the “for sale” sign.</p>

			<p style="display: inline-block;float:left">We returned to Swan’s Island for a week in July of 2018 and began to look for a property in earnest. We were staying on the western part of the island, three miles down a twisting, bumpy, mostly single lane seasonal road. We didn’t want that and started to narrow our search to the Atlantic side of the island. That area offered paved roads, more privacy that the villages on Burnt Coat Harbor and a wonderful view of the mountains of Acadia. In the next months we set our sights on the Cloud house. It had privacy, plenty of land and water frontage and a long history, being built in the 1850’s. After an inspection to determine is the house was solid and worth restoring (it was) we made an offer and it was accepted. The prior owner’s family had owned it for 70 years and left us a <a href="./images/Message.JPG">wonderful note</a> welcoming us. </p>

			<p style="display: inline-block;">Since then we were able to engage a local contractor with a long history of similar renovations and the work has begun. The <a href="house-demo.html" >demolition inside </a> is completing and reconstruction will start soon!</p>
