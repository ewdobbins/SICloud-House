				<h2>Welcome </h2>
			<p>Swan's Island, and our Cloud House there, is a special place for us and this web site provides some of the background why. We hope to see many of our family and friends here often. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/travel/mount-desert-s-little-neighbors.html">New York Times article</a> from 1994 includes the following description of the islands off MDI, <i>"...the old frame houses are occupied only in summer by residents now drawn by that very sense of separateness and simplicity"</i>. This description of the attraction of the islands off MDI suits us pretty well.</p>
			<p>On this site we will provide links to other sites that can provide more depth than we could (or would want to) on their topics. (That's the beauty of the web!) We will also attempt to add our own insight into the Swan's Island experience, providing information and color through our eyes. </p>
			<p>Broadly the topics we want to cover are: some history of the island, and Cloud House, an  overview of what you can do out at the island and some options on how to get here. We also have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/SICloudHouse">Facebook page</a> for the more social media oriented. Feel free to "like" the page for semi-regular updates. </p>
