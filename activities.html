			<h2>Island Attractions and Activities</h2>
			
			<p> This page should give you a decent idea what the range of things there are to do out on the island and what accomodations you might want to consider. Additionally, here is our <a href="calendar.html">informal calendar</a> of activities in the area that may be of interest in determing the timing of a visit although friends and family are welcome any time.</p>

			<h3>Dining and Shopping</h3>
			<p>These two staples of vacationing are in scarce supply on Swan’s Island. There are no restaurants on Swan’s Island to speak of, although <a href="http://www.tims-swans-island.com/">TIMS</a> can be counted on to provide breakfast, lunch and dinner with a limited menu. The pizza is remarkably good though and worth ordering on days it is available. There is supposedly a crepe place, Bistro Roux, over in Minturn, but we never saw it open in our time on the island. If the urge for a more varied lunch or dinner off island is strong though, we can run out on the boat to many options less than a 20 minute ride away.</p> 

			<p>If dining is restricted then souvenir shopping is similarly limited. You won’t see streets full of merchants like in Bar Harbor. Your shopping will be pretty much limited to the gift shop at the lighthouse (pretty good selection), Iver Studio (antiques), the Blue Buoy (a thrift store) and a selection of <a href="http://www.tims-swans-island.com/">TIMS</a> baseball hats at their store.</p>

			<p>Food and grocery  shopping does present a more accommodating solution. TIMS has pretty much all you could want for when shopping for food. It is very limited in brand variety but it covers a decent range and is good stuff. The docks are also a place to score very fresh lobster and scallops. </p>

			<h3>Hiking Trails</h3>
			<p>Swan's Island has many trails to hike. They cross a mix of public and private land so please be considerate on your hikes. Many trails are  <a href="http://www.swansisland.org/map.pdf">mapped here</a> but some some are not. Notably, the <a href="./images/Noahs-ballast.PNG">Noah's Ballast hike </a>and the shortcut down the power lines to the ferry terminal are not. <p>

			<h3>On Island Attractions</h3>
			<p>There are several noted attractions such as the light house, lobster museum and library detailed on  <a href="http://www.swansisland.org/index.htm">swansisland.org</a> </p>

			<h3>Surrounding Island Destinations</h3>
			<p>The waters around Swan's Island are reputed to be the best boating on the east coast. Some of these islands in this region are within reach by a "mail boat" or via a ferry. Many do not have this access though and getting to them requires a private boat. Since we have a boat moored in Mackeral Cove, our guests should consider all the islands in the area as fair game for sightseeing! Our summary of some of the area islands is described in the  <a href="other-islands.html">following link</a>. A very comprehensive list of island preserves is also available on <a href="https://mcht.org/preserves/index.php"> the Maine Coast Heritage Trust preserves page</a>. 
				
			<h3>Stargazing</h3>
			<p> <i> "With the tranquility of the night and the majesty of the stellar array, stargazing becomes an almost hypnotic experience, like watching dancing flames in a fireplace." </i>-Terrence Dickinson, Nightwatch. </p>

			<p>Maine's coast line is home to some of the last pristine night sky east of the Mississippi River. Swan's Island is a <a href="./images/Dark-skies.jpg">particularly good spot</a> for stargazing, even better than typical on the coastline, without any real light from coastal towns and villages. Plan on going out in the evening, before the moon rises or after it sets, and seeing the <a href="./images/Acadia-night-sky.JPG">Milky Way and a density of stars </a> in the sky that can be disorienting to some and awe inspiring to most all. </p>
