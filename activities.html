			<h2>Island Attractions and Activities</h2>
			
			<p> This page should give you a decent idea what the range of things there are to do out on the island and what accomodations you might want to consider. Additionally, here is an <a href="calendar.html">informal calendar</a> of activities in the area that may be of interest in determing the timing of a visit although friends and family are welcome any time.</p>

			<h3>Dining and Shopping</h3>
			<p>These two staples of vacationing are in scarce supply on Swan’s Island. There are no restaurants on Swan’s Island to speak of, although <a href="http://www.tims-swans-island.com/">TIMS</a> can be counted on to provide breakfast, lunch and dinner with a limited menu. The pizza is remarkably good though and worth ordering on days it is available. There is supposedly a crepe place, Bistro Roux, over in Minturn, but we never saw it open in our time on the island. If the urge for a more varied lunch or dinner off island is strong though, we can run out on the boat to many options less than a 20 minute ride away.</p> 

			<p>If dining is restricted then souvenir shopping is more limited. You won’t see streets full of merchants like in Bar Harbor. Your shopping will be pretty much limited to the gift shop at the lighthouse (pretty good selection), the Blue Buoy (a thrift store) and <a href="http://www.tims-swans-island.com/">TIMS</a> baseball hats at their store.</p>

			<p>Food and grocery  shopping does present a more accommodating solution. TIMS has pretty much all you could want for when shopping for food. It is very limited in brand variety but it covers a decent range and is good stuff. The docks are also a place to score very fresh lobster and scallops. </p>

			<h3>Hiking Trails</h3>
			<h3>On Island Attractions</h3>
			<p>There are several noted attractions such as the light house, lobster museum and library detailed on  <a href="http://www.swansisland.org/index.htm">swansisland.org</a> </p>
			<h3>Surrounding Island Destinations</h3>
			<p>The waters around Swan's Island are reputed to be the best boating on the east coast. Some of these islands in this region are within reach by a "mail boat" or via a ferry. Many do not have this access though and getting to them requires a private boat. Since we have a boat moored in Mackeral Cove, our guests should consider all the islands in the area as fair game for sightseeing! Many of the area islands are described in the  <a href="other-islands.html">following link</a>
			<h3>Stargazing</h3>
