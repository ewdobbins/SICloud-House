			<h2>Calendar of Events </h2>
			
			<ul> 
				<li>Lobster boat races occur throughout the summer. The exact calendar has not been published yet but based on the <a href="http://www.maine-lylobster.com/2018/03/the-maine-lobster-boat-races-schedule-2018.html">2018 calendar</a> the races will be scheduled from June through August. The readily accessible, by boat, venues are Stonington, Winter Harbor, Rockland and Bass Harbor. </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.castineclassic.com/">Castine Classic Yacht Race</a>, August 1. This will be the 20th anniversary of this race and there will be activities ashore in Castine as well as on the water.</li>
				<li><a href="https://camdenyachtclub.org/cruising-racing/wooden-boat-series/">Camden Classic Race Regatta</a>, August 2. This year will mark the 32 year anniversary of this race where wooden boats race from Camden to Brooklin as a prelude to the ERR. </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.erregatta.com/">Eggemoggin Reach Regatta(ERR)</a>, August 3. The ERR is a race for wooden boats over a 15 mile course. It has grown in popularity over 30 years and now hosts upwards of 100 wooden boats.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.sweetchariotmusicfestival.com/">Sweet Chariot Music Festival</a>, August 6-9. This is an enduring folk music festival on Swan’s Island. There are three venues where it can be enjoyed. The first in on the water in Burnt Coat Harbor the afternoon of the first two days. There is no ticket required but you do have to find a boat to get there on. The second venue is in the Odd Fellows Hall for evening performances starting at 7:30 with tickets going for a bargain of $20 and likely to sell out. The third venue is just up the street a few hundred feet from us at the director Doug Day’s place. Once the evening performance completes it appears the musicians and friends descend on Doug’s place to continue the festivities.</li>
