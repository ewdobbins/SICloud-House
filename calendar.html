			<h2>Calendar of Events, 2024 </h2>

			
			<ul> 
				<li>Lobster boat races occur throughout the summer. The  <a href="https://untamedmainer.com/maine-lobster-boat-races-2024/">2024 calendar</a> is published and the races will be scheduled from June through August. The readily accessible (by boat) venues are Stonington, Winter Harbor and Bass Harbor. </li>
				<li>Cruise ship <a href="https://maine.portcall.com/#!?tab=2&port=Bar%20Harbor">arrivals and departures</a>. Bar Harbor hosts many of the largest cruise ships in the world, including the <a href="./images/Qm2-atsea.jpg">Queen Mary 2</a> on occasion. Several of these ships exceed 1000 feet in length and displace more than a US Navy supercarrier. The recommended route for these vessels lies to the east of Swan's Island with the <a href="./images/Pilot-channel.jpg">pilot rendevous</a> just a mile, or so, east of the Cranberry islands. A short, early morning or late afternoon, boat ride to the east of the Cranberries will provide a <a href="./images/Cruise-ship1.jpg">rare view</a> of one of these behemoths in a more dynamic setting than the harbor.  </li>
				<li><a href="https://www.visitbarharbor.com/july-4th"> Bar Harbor Fourth of July</a>, Bar Harbor’s Fourth of July has been voted the #1 Fourth of July celebration in America by the Today Show and recognized by National Geographic as one of the top ten in the U.S.</li>
				<li>Swan's Island Fireman's Lobster Feed,  a fundraiser for the island's fire department typically scheduled for late July. In addition to a great lobster (or burger) lunch, there is a silent auction with some very nice local artwork included. </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.castineclassic.com/">Castine Classic Yacht Race</a>, August 1. This will be the 25th anniversary of this race and there will be activities ashore in Castine as well as on the water.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.camdenclassicscup.com/">Camden Classic Race Regatta</a>, July 25-27, This regatta is where wooden boats race from Camden to Brooklin as a prelude to the ERR. </li>
				<li><a href="https://www.eggemogginreachregatta.com/">Eggemoggin Reach Regatta(ERR)</a>, August 3. The ERR is a race for wooden boats over a 15 mile course. It has grown in popularity over 30 years and now hosts upwards of 100 wooden boats. At its closet point, the southern turn on the course is visible from the west side of Swan's Island. The <a href="./images/ERR1.jpeg">start</a> is a short boat ride across Jericho Bay.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.sweetchariotmusicfestival.com/">Sweet Chariot Music Festival</a>, August 6-8. This is an, enduring folk music festival on Swan’s Island. There are three venues where it can be enjoyed. The first is <a href="https://youtu.be/uumrJQuCDew">on the water</a> in Burnt Coat Harbor the afternoon of the first two days. There is no ticket required but you do have to find a boat to get there on. The second venue is in the <a href="https://youtu.be/fJlxqIRLVuE" >Odd Fellows Hall</a> for evening performances starting at 7:30 with tickets going for a bargain of $20 and likely to sell out. The third venue is <a href="https://youtu.be/HnFg7942ov4?t=46">just up the street</a> a few hundred feet from us at the director Doug Day’s place. (Once the evening performance completes it appears the musicians and friends descend on Doug’s place to continue the festivities.)</li>
				<li><a href="CH-invitational.html">Cloud House Invitational Golf Tournament</a>, August 26. This year will celebrate the third year of this event, considered by some golfers to be the fifth major event of the year. </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.acadianightskyfestival.org/">Acadia Night Sky Festival</a>, TBD. A premier night sky event on the eastern seaboard. The link has an event list (TBD).</li>
