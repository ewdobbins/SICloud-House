			<h2>Calendar of Events, 2020 </h2>
			
			<ul> 
				<li>Lobster boat races occur throughout the summer. The exact calendar has not been published yet but based on the <a href="http://www.maine-lylobster.com/2020/01/maine-lobster-boat-races-schedule-for-2020.html">2020 calendar</a> the races will be scheduled from June through August. The readily accessible, by boat, venues are Stonington, Winter Harbor, Rockland and Bass Harbor. </li>
				<li>Cruise ship <a href="https://www.barharbormaine.gov/DocumentCenter/View/922/2019-Cruise-Ship-Schedule">arrivals and departures</a>. Bar Harbor hosts many of the largest cruise ships in the world, including the <a href="./images/Qm2-atsea.jpg">Queen Mary 2</a> on September 3rd. Several of these ships exceed 1000 feet in length and displace more than a US Navy supercarrier. The recommended route for these vessels lies to the east of Swan's Island with the <a href="./images/Pilot-channel.jpg">pilot rendevous</a> just a mile, or so, east of the Cranberry islands. A short early morning, or late afternoon, boat ride to the east of the Cranberries will provide a rare view of one of these behemoths in a more dynamic setting than the harbor  </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.visitbarharbor.com/july-4th"> Bar Harbor Fourth of July</a>, Bar Harbor’s Fourth of July has been voted the #1 Fourth of July celebration in America by the Today Show and recognized by National Geographic as one of the top ten in the U.S.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.castineclassic.com/">Castine Classic Yacht Race</a>, TBD. This will be the 21st anniversary of this race and there will be activities ashore in Castine as well as on the water.</li>
				<li><a href="https://camdenyachtclub.org/cruising-racing/wooden-boat-series/">Camden Classic Race Regatta</a>, TBD This year will mark the 33 year anniversary of this race where wooden boats race from Camden to Brooklin as a prelude to the ERR. </li>
				<li><a href="http://www.erregatta.com/">Eggemoggin Reach Regatta(ERR)</a>, August 1. The ERR is a race for wooden boats over a 15 mile course. It has grown in popularity over 30 years and now hosts upwards of 100 wooden boats.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.sweetchariotmusicfestival.com/">Sweet Chariot Music Festival</a>, TBD. This is an enduring folk music festival on Swan’s Island. There are three venues where it can be enjoyed. The first is <a href="https://youtu.be/uumrJQuCDew">on the water</a> in Burnt Coat Harbor the afternoon of the first two days. There is no ticket required but you do have to find a boat to get there on. The second venue is in the <a href="https://youtu.be/fJlxqIRLVuE" >Odd Fellows Hall</a> for evening performances starting at 7:30 with tickets going for a bargain of $20 and likely to sell out. The third venue is <a href="https://youtu.be/HnFg7942ov4?t=46">just up the street</a> a few hundred feet from us at the director Doug Day’s place. Once the evening performance completes it appears the musicians and friends descend on Doug’s place to continue the festivities.</li>
				<li><a href="http://www.acadianightskyfestival.org/">Acadia Night Sky Festival</a>, September 16-20. A premier night sky event on the eastern seaboard. The link has an event list (TBD).</li>
